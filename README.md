# Third-Order-Euler-Method

In this project I implement a highly customizable third-order euler method with local extrapolation and step correction, also tracking various statistics about the algorithm as it is being used, such as Steps Rejected and Steps Accepted. I use the method to simulate the trajectory of a planet orbiting a moon.
